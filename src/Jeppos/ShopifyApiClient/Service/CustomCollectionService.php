 * A custom collection is a grouping of products that a shop owner can create to make their shops easier to browse.
 * A shop owner creates a custom collection and then selects the products that will go into it.

 * Custom collections are typically displayed to customers so that customers can select them to view only the products
 * in the collection they've selected. They're typically used to break down a catalog of products into categories to
 * make the shop easier to browse. Shopify shops start with a single custom collection called frontpage â€”
 * the collection of products shown on the shop's front page.
